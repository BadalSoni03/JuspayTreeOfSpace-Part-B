# JuspayTreeOfSpace-Part-B

This is the 100% correct solution of Part B of JUSPAY's hackathon implemented in Java. However the implementation is language independent because I was not allowed to use any library (related to multithreading and process synchronisation) to implement my logic. 

The code is optimized (according to the time complexity asked in the interview) and also thread safe.

The above is the link to the solution of part A's problem (not optimized)
